**Bookstore Application**
This project is a JavaFX-based web application for a bookstore, featuring client and server interfaces, and integrating a database system to manage bookkeeping records. The application allows clients to seamlessly rent books and proceed with checkouts.

**Features**

**User Interface:** The application provides a user-friendly interface developed using JavaFX, allowing users to browse available books, search for specific titles or authors, view book details, and initiate the checkout process.

**Client-Server Architecture:** The application follows a client-server architecture, with the client-side implemented using JavaFX for the graphical user interface and the server-side implemented using Java frameworks like Spring Boot or Java EE.

**Database Integration:** The application integrates with a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and manage bookkeeping records. It supports operations such as adding new books, updating book details, and tracking book rentals and checkouts.

**Renting and Checkout:** Clients can rent books from the bookstore's inventory and proceed with checkouts through the application. The checkout process includes selecting books, providing user information, and confirming the rental transaction.
